# Two Peaks Chai Co. – Website Overview

## Savor Tradition, One Sip at a Time
Delight in the perfect blend of **traditional Indian spices** and **modern wellness elements**.

## The Founders
Two Peaks was founded by **Hannah and Prasad Pagade** in Colorado.  
Inspired by their shared journey of healing and connection, they created chai blends that merge culture, comfort, and mindfulness.

## Our Mission
To create chai experiences that **transcend boundaries**, **evoke emotions**, and **bring balance** to everyday life.

## The Ritual
We honor the ancient art of chai-making — by simmering the spices first to awaken aroma and healing potential.  
It’s slower, richer, and more intentional — chai as it was meant to be experienced.
