    "assistant_response": "Brewing our Signature Masala Chai is a delightful experience! Here\u2019s a simple method to enjoy its rich flavors:\n\n1. **Ingredients**: You\u2019ll need 1-2 teaspoons of our Signature Masala Chai, water, milk (or a dairy alternative), and sweetener if desired.\n\n2. **Boil Water**: Start by boiling 1 cup of water in a saucepan.\n\n3. **Add Chai**: Once the water is boiling, add the chai blend and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. This allows the spices to infuse beautifully.\n\n4. **Add Milk**: Pour in 1 cup of milk and bring the mixture back to a boil. You can adjust the milk ratio based on your preference for creaminess.\n\n5. **Sweeten**: If you like your chai sweet, add sugar or honey to taste.\n\n6. **Strain and Serve**: Strain the chai into your favorite cup and enjoy the warm, comforting flavors!\n\nIf you\u2019re new to our blends, I recommend trying our Founder\u2019s Ritual Sampler Box.
