# About Two Peaks Chai Co.

Welcome to **Two Peaks Chai Co.** — where Indian heritage meets Colorado wellness.  
We are **Hannah and Prasad Pagade**, partners in life, business, and tea.

## Our Story
What started as a cross-cultural love story became a shared mission.  
After years in healthcare and technology, we felt called to create something more personal — a bridge between tradition and wellness.  
Chai was our daily anchor, a moment of calm that became the heart of our business.

## Our Philosophy
We don’t just sell chai — we share a ritual.  
A slow, grounding experience that connects people to themselves and to each other.

Every blend is:
- Crafted in small batches
- Made with **whole spices** (never powders)
- Designed to **energize, soothe, and heal**

## Our Mission
To blend **heritage with modern wellness** — offering chai that nourishes body, mind, and spirit.

✨ Two peaks. Two cultures. One shared ritual.
